# cryptoGrapher

This project aims to create a python application generating graphs of cryptocurrency prices. 

As of now, the plans are to include:
-- GUI,
-- Customizable timeFrames of graphed data,
-- Customizable graphs (change graph type, change scale),
-- Plotting more than 1 cryptocurrency on 1 graph,
-- Normalization of the graph (probably done by normalization of datasets?).


I'm learning on the go and skill development is the main purpose of this project. So the idea of cryptoGrapher may change vastly in the future. 
Got any ideas on what you would love to see implemented? Make sure to let me know.

Anyone is free to join on the journey.
